    "text": "This months has been pretty interesting. I have learned several things like how to use Gatsby and GraphQL. I have been working on auto-clock-speed a lot, and I 0.1.8 was released! I have also been writing code for the Hermes project. This months I picked up the book 'Design Patterns' and it's great. Something that I have been using more often is React. Sometimes I forget how useful a good frontend framework can be. On an unrelated note, I have been learning more about computer science theory and software development history. Knowing what others did in the past is helpful when making decision."

    "text": "This month, I registered the domains finditlocal.org and finditlocal.us for a company called Local List I started in connection with my Econ class. I created a frontend using React and a backend using Django. Currently, both are hosted and communicating to display local products at those domains. I am really excited for this project and I even printed business cards and stickers for the project to share with classmates. I feel like this project is the latest culmination of my skills in frontend, backend, and system architecture. The part I am most proud of is the architecture and design decisions to allow for further development and higher traffic as the project grows. I also worked more on my yet to be released (as of March 31st 2022) runtime-analysis-paper, including a new idea I thought of regarding error handling."
